**Info**

The web server is presented in ionicwebwrapper folder. While source source is pre-packed in the folder "/dist", there also is a possibility to rebuild (to make changes in frontend and etc.); in order to do that, you need to install NodeJS on your machine, then run "npm install" while being in folder __ionicwebwrapper__ to install necesserely dependencies. Then you can write __npm run build__ to pre-package frontend with last changes.
